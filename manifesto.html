      <p>1. Good design is not simply one thing. Designers cannot be narrow-minded. Designers must consider the multiple aspects that enable the generation of successful designs, or else fall into the pit of creating useless junk.</p>
      <p>2. Design with conviction to your work. If you can&#39;t believe in it, don&#39;t expect anyone else it. Make sure you can be proud to call it your own, or why should someone want it for themselves? &#34;Work on what it stands for&#34; (Mau, 2010), design as a means of expression creates powerful design.</p>
      <p>3. Challenge the rules of what is okay &#150; if you can&#39;t test the boundaries, you&#39;re no better than a sheep, following the path of those before you.</p> 
      <h3>&#34;Our job is to jump the fences and cross the fields&#34; <p>(Mau, 2010)</p></h3>
      <p>so defy the norm &#150; that is the path of discovering something new and wonderful. If you can&#39;t test the boundaries who is going to? Don&#39;t be afraid to be unexpected, odds are you&#39;re on the way of creating something revolutionary.</p>
      <p>4. Don&#39;t limit yourself to certain technologies, get your hands dirty with hand craft and computers alike because &#34;creativity is not device-dependent&#34; (Mau, 2010). Otherwise you&#39;ll be stuck with the limitations of one, rather than the benefits of both &#150; &#34;remember, tools amplify our capacities&#34; (Mau, 2010).</p>
      <p>5. Be sustainable. &#34;Our anthropocentric worldview is literally killing us&#34; (Chocohinov, n.d.) &#150; you live in this world, so take care of it. Use your head and consider materiality and production cost alike, you have a brain for a reason.</p>
      <p>6. Innovate. Don&#39;t regurgitate ideas that people have done before you, push yourself to think of your own, &#34;free yourself from limits of this sort&#34; (Mau, 2010).</p>
      <p>7. If you put off an idea long enough, disregard it. 
      <h3>&#34;If you wait more than a week to get an idea done, abandon it&#34; <p>(Pettis, and Stark, 2010)</p></h3>
      <p> If it can&#39;t hold your own attention how can you expect it to be good enough to capture others?</p>
      <p>8. Iterate. &#34;Do Mistakes&#34; (Pettis, and Stark, 2010), mistakes are a step closer to new design. Good design requires experimentation. If you can&#39;t build and learn as you design, are you really getting the most out of the process? &#34;Collect the wrong answers as part of the process... Allow failure and migration to be part of your practice&#34; (Mau, 2010).</p>
      <p>9. Research. &#34;A studio is a place of study&#34; (Mau, 2010), this helps create more considered and educated design decisions &#150; which result in better designs. Lack of research and understanding &#34;results in people fundamentally not understanding the workings of their built artifacts and environments&#34; (Chochinov, n.d.).</p>
      <p>10.  Designers must address the issues. Don&#39;t hide your head in the sand, stand up for what needs to change. One of the fundamentals of becoming a good designer is &#34;understanding that all design happens within a context&#34; (Chochinov, n.d.)</p>
